Various little blender scripts that aren't worth the effort of turning them into an addon (at least not to me). Maybe they'll help you?

"font load" works only on linux but it loads all fonts you have installed in the default location into blender

"text anim" copies the the animation path of one object and applies to a number of text objects it can generate from a piece of raw text. I wanted to turn this intoan addon that you can easily create star wars like intros with, except with a more interesting path for the text to take, but when you've seen the same animation two or three times it gets kind of boring.
